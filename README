    A pure-perl version is being maintained by Makamaka Hannyaharamitu
    as Text::CSV_PP, which tries to follow Text::CSV_XS very closely.

    Text::CSV_PP is bundled in Text::CSV, which now is a wrapper module over
    Text::CSV_XS and Text::CSV_PP that will select Text::CSV_XS if available,
    and otherwise use Text::PP.
