# more headers options

   headers => {
       # straight-forward renaming (done)
       foomugdro           => "bar",

       # ideas
       qr{^post[ck]ode$}i  => "pc",
       --options           => {
           NAME_lc  => 1, # make all headers lower case
               # now FOOmugDRO will also map to bar
           maxlen   => 3, # chomp at max n characters
               # foomugdro will be mapped to foo
           unique   => 1, # add random shit if header is duplicate
               # first  foo will map to foo
               # second foo will map to foo000
           },
       }

# validate - croak or fail on invalid
#            allow action  on invalid

csv (in        => "foo.csv",
     validate  => sub { ($_->[1][3] // "") =~ m/^[0-9]+$/ ? 1 : 0 },
     );

what would that add over "after_parse" ?

# filter - key is field number (one-based), block should pass
#          if cross-reference between fields required, use validate
#          multiple sections are AND-ed, all should PASS

csv (in     => "foo.csv",
     filter => { 6 => sub { length > 4 }},
     );
